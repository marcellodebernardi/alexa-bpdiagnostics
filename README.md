## Repository for team Snack Overflow (BP-Imperial Hackathon)

Simple Alexa skill demo used to present the business idea developed by team Snack Overflow during the BP-Imperial Hackathon 2017. In the demo, Alexa takes the user through a simple conversation in which the user requests Alexa to diagnose his/her vehicle, and subsequently makes an appointment with a mechanic.

We envisioned this as a voice-activated service BP could offer at its petrol stations, such that customers could plug an OBD dongle into their vehicles while refuelling and get a quick and easy checkup of their vehicle's condition.

The idea won first prize at the hackathon.
